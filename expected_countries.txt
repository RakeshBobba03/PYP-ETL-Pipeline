Expected Country Values for ETL Processing
==========================================

Based on the schema analysis, the system expects countries to match exactly what's in the Dgraph database.

Common Country Formats (try these):
- USA (instead of "United States")
- Canada
- Mexico
- UK (instead of "United Kingdom")
- Germany
- France
- Australia
- Japan
- China
- India

Note: The exact values depend on what's already in your Dgraph database.
If you get "Country not found" errors, you may need to:
1. Check what countries exist in your database
2. Use the exact country names/abbreviations from your database
3. Add new countries to your database schema first

For testing purposes, try using:
- USA
- Canada  
- Mexico

These are most likely to exist in a typical North American database.

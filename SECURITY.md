# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Product/Ingredient Matching System to address identified vulnerabilities and ensure secure operation.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. CSRF Protection
- **Issue**: Forms were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented Flask-WTF with CSRF tokens on all forms
- **Files**: `app/__init__.py`, `app/templates/*.html`

### 2. Strong Secret Key Enforcement
- **Issue**: Weak default secret key could be exploited
- **Fix**: Enforced strong secret key requirement in production
- **Files**: `app/__init__.py`, `app/config.py`

### 3. Path Traversal Prevention
- **Issue**: File download endpoints vulnerable to directory traversal
- **Fix**: Added filename validation and path normalization
- **Files**: `app/routes.py`

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Issue**: No input validation could lead to XSS and injection attacks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive input validation and HTML sanitization
- **Files**: `app/etl.py`

### 5. Race Condition Prevention
- **Issue**: Multiple file uploads could cause data corruption
- **Fix**: Implemented proper database transactions and constraints
- **Files**: `app/etl.py`, `app/models.py`

### 6. Memory Security
- **Issue**: Large files could cause memory exhaustion
- **Fix**: Implemented row-by-row processing
- **Files**: `app/etl.py`

### 7. Dgraph Response Validation
- **Issue**: Silent failures on invalid responses
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive response validation and error handling
- **Files**: `app/routes.py`

### 8. Configurable Security Thresholds
- **Issue**: Hard-coded fuzzy matching thresholds
- **Fix**: Made thresholds configurable via environment variables
- **Files**: `app/etl.py`, `docker-compose.yml`

### 9. Database Constraints
- **Issue**: No database-level constraints to prevent duplicates
- **Fix**: Added unique constraints and indexes
- **Files**: `app/models.py`

### 10. Retry Mechanisms
- **Issue**: No retry logic for failed operations
- **Fix**: Implemented exponential backoff retry for Dgraph operations
- **Files**: `app/routes.py`

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production
```bash
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-key>
FLASK_ENV=production
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD=80.0          # Default: 80.0
AUTO_RESOLVE_THRESHOLD=95.0         # Default: 95.0
DGRAPH_TIMEOUT=30                   # Default: 30 seconds
DGRAPH_MAX_RETRIES=3                # Default: 3
DGRAPH_RETRY_DELAY=1                # Default: 1 second
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. File Upload Security
- File type validation (only .xlsx, .xls, .csv allowed)
- File size limits (16MB max)
- Path traversal prevention
- Secure filename handling

### 2. Database Security
- Parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Database constraints and indexes
- Transaction management

### 3. API Security
- Request timeout limits
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Response validation
- Error logging without information disclosure

### 4. Session Security
- Secure session cookies in production
- HTTP-only cookies
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Configurable session lifetime

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events Logged
- Failed authentication attempts
- Path traversal attempts
- Invalid file uploads
- Dgraph operation failures
- Database constraint violations

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Normal operations
- **WARNING**: Suspicious activities
- **ERROR**: Security violations and failures

## Deployment Security

### Docker Security
- No new privileges
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Temporary filesystem for /tmp
- Non-root user execution

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set strong FLASK_SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Set FLASK_ENV=production
- [ ] Use HTTPS
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Enable security monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database backup encryption

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate**: Stop affected services
2. **Assessment**: Identify scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and evidence
5. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups
6. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned

### Contact Information
- Security Team: security@company.com
- Emergency: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX

## Regular Security Tasks

### Monthly
- Review access logs
- Update dependencies
- Security scan reports

### Quarterly
- Security audit
- Penetration testing
- Security training

### Annually
- Security policy review
- Incident response plan update
- Compliance assessment

## Compliance

This system is designed to meet:
- OWASP Top 10 security requirements
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry standard security practices

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **DO NOT** disclose it publicly
2. Email security@company.com
3. Include detailed description and steps to reproduce
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure

## Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial security implementation
- **v1.1**: Added CSRF protection and input validation
